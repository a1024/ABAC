This repository contains my attempts and experiments to better understand image compression.
I didn't invent the algorithms used here, but tried to improve the implementations.

Each folder here contains a different project.
The most up-to-date projects are:
- pxView3D:  A visualization and benchmarking tool for image transforms.
- entropy-battle:  An image compression benchmark.

The other folders are outdated.
