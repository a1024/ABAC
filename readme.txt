This repository contains my attempts and experiments to better understand image compression.
I didn't invent the algorithms used here, but tried to improve the implementations.

Each folder here contains a different project.
The most up-to-date projects are:
- best:      The most efficient algorithm so far (without speed considerations).

- lossy:     Experiments on lossy compression.

- pxView3D:  A visualization and benchmarking tool for reversible image transforms.
- e2:        Experiments on lossless compression. Newer, cleaner project.
- entropy-battle:  Experiments on lossless image compression. Older, messier project, contains more obsolete techniques.

The other folders are outdated.
